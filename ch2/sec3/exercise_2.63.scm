; The first procedure has a recurrence relation of T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + O(n) due
; to the use of append. By the master theorem, time complexity: O(nlogn)

; The second procedure has a recurrence relation of T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + O(1) due
; to cons taking O(1) time. By the master theorem, time complexity: O(n)
