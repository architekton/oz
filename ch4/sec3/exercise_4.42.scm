; I found that with most of these puzzles approaching them with a table makes
; them quite easy. Assume one is true and follow the rules of logic presented
; in the question and you will either get a contradiction, or the correct
; answer. I did this on paper and the answer is

; Kitty - 1
; Joan - 2
; Betty - 3
; Mary - 4
; Ethel - 5
