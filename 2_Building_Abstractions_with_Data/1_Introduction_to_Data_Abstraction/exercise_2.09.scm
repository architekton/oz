; TODO, express the width of the resulting interval as the witdhs of the initial
; intervals

; Counterexample
; [1, 2] * [1, 2] = [1, 4] -> width of 3/2
; [2, 3] * [2, 3] = [4, 9] -> width of 5/2
; both examples have initial intervals of width 1/2, however their resulting
; widths after multiplication are not the same
